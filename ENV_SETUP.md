cp .env.example .env
```

2. Open `.env` in your text editor

3. Replace the placeholder values:
```env
# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Unsplash API Key
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Server Port (optional, defaults to 3001)
PORT=3001
```

4. Save the file

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:**

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Never share your API keys publicly
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- If you accidentally expose a key, revoke it immediately and generate a new one

## Testing Your Setup

After setting up your `.env` file, test the APIs:

1. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Check the console for any errors
3. Try generating content with a simple keyword
4. If you see errors, check:
   - API keys are correct
   - No extra spaces or quotes in `.env` file
   - You have internet connection
   - API services are not down

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid API key"**
- Double-check you copied the entire key
- Make sure there are no spaces before or after the key
- Verify the key is active in your OpenAI/Unsplash dashboard

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- You've made too many requests
- Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually 1 hour for Unsplash)
- Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits

**"Insufficient credits"**
- Your OpenAI account needs to be funded
- Add a payment method at [OpenAI Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)

## Free Alternatives

If you don't want to use paid APIs immediately:

**For Testing GPT:**
- Use `gpt-3.5-turbo` (cheaper than GPT-4)
- OpenAI gives $5 free credit to new accounts
- Or use mock data during development

**For Unsplash:**
- 50 requests/hour should be enough for testing
- For production, apply for production access (free but needs approval)
